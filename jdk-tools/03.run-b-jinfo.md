# jinfo

## Basic usage

```bash
jinfo <process ID> 
jinfo <core file>
```

## Description

This tool displays the **system properties** and **JVM options** for a running Java process (or a core file).

## Common switches

- `-flags`: Display JVM flags only
- `-sysprops`: Display system properties only

Notes  
In practice, this is **very rarely used**â€”although it can **occasionally be useful** as a sanity check that the expected program is actually what is executing.
