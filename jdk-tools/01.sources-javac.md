# javac

## Basic usage

```bash
javac some/package/MyClass.java
```

## Description

`javac` is the **Java source code compiler**—it produces **bytecode** (in the form of `.class` files) from `.java` **source files**.

## Common switches

- `-classpath`: Supplies classes we need for compilation.
- `-d some/dir`: Tells `javac` where to output class files.

source and target

- `-source <version>`: Control the Java version that javac will accept.
- `-target <version>`: Control the version of class files that javac will output.

debug

- `-g`: Generate all debugging info
- `-g:none`: Generate no debugging info
- `-g:{lines,vars,source}`: Generate only some debugging info

查看Byte Code的时候，我喜欢使用`-g:vars`参数：

```bash
javac -g:vars Main.java
```

- `-profile <profile>`: Control the profile that javac will use when compiling the application.

## source and target

`javac` has traditionally accepted switches (`-source` and `-target`) that control **the version of the source language** that the compiler would accept, and **the version of the class file format** that was used for the outputted class files.

From JDK 8 onward, javac will only accept **source** and **target** options from **three versions back**. That is, only the formats from JDK 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be accepted by `javac`. This does not affect the **java interpreter**—any class file from any Java version will still work on the JVM shipped with Java 8.

## 一时兴起

过去，我经常使用`javac Hello.java`；今天突然遇到`javac *.java`，原来也可以这么用啊。

```bash
$ javac *.java
```
