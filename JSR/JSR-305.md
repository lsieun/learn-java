# JSR-305: Annotations for Software Defect Detection

Static Analysis tools such as `FindBugs`, `IntelliJ`, `Checkstyle` and `PMD` are widely used in Java development. The tools are sophisticated, but there are **a common set of problems** which they handle poorly. These are generally implicit design decisions in the APIs such as where a value can be null, or where a numeric value is not expected to be negative. In Java, a well written API will capture these design details in the JavaDoc but they are not easily accessible to the analysis tools and, in consequence, may either be missed or result in false positives.

**To work around this problem** a number of static analysis tool developers are exploring using annotations to define these details. For example `FindBugs` and `IntelliJ` both define their own annotations to indicate when a method may return null. The two tools use **slightly different annotations** however and so there is a case for standardisation. `JSR-305`, led by FindBugs' creator **Bill Pugh**, is looking to create both **a standard set of annotations** that analysis tools can use, and **a mechanism to allow developers to add additional annotations** as they need to. The current proposal includes annotations for nullness, sign, language, and threading amongst others.
