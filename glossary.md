## B

bit·wise  
[adj]  
designating **an operator** in a programming language that manipulates **the individual bits** in a **byte** or **word**.

## E

### Endpoint

A more common definition for `endpoint` in computer networking, architecture, and operations, however, **is a mobile device** such as a laptop(笔记本电脑, 膝上型电脑), phone, or tablet(平板电脑).

The term has its origin in reference to **computer networks**. The `endpoint` is **a device or node** that is connected to the **LAN** or **WAN** and accepts communications back and forth across the network. 

In **a traditional sense**, an `endpoint` can be a modem, hub, bridge, or switch. It also could be data terminal equipment (such as a digital telephone handset, router, or printer) or a host computer (such as a workstation or a server).

> modem: 调制解调器，俗称“猫”，是一种计算机硬件。它能把计算机的数字信号翻译成可沿普通电话线传送的脉冲信号  
> hub: 集线器，是一个多端口的转发器，在以HUB为中心设备时，即使网络中某条线路产生了故障，并不影响其它线路的工作。  
> bridge: 桥接器，一种网络设备，负责网络桥接（network bridging）之用。  
> switch: 交换器，它的前身是网桥。SWITCH速度比HUB快，这是由于HUB不知道目标地址在何处，发送数据到所有的端口。  

## F

### FQCN

**FQCN** stands for **F**ully-**Q**ualified **C**lass **N**ame 

Example:

The `java.lang` package is imported automatically into all source files. In case there are two or more classes with the same name but defined in different imported (or assumed) packages, then those classes must be referenced by their **fully-qualified-class-name** (**FQCN**).

## G

### glob (programming)

In computer programming, **glob** patterns specify sets of filenames with **wildcard characters**. For example, the Unix command `mv *.txt textfiles/` moves (mv) all files with names ending in `.txt` from the current directory to the directory `textfiles`. Here, `*` is a wildcard standing for "any string of characters" and `*.txt` is a glob pattern. The other common wildcard is the question mark (`?`), which stands for one character.

The **glob** command, short for global, originates in the earliest versions of Bell Labs' Unix. Later, this functionality was provided as a library function, `glob()`, used by programs such as the shell.

## N

A **network interface** is the point of interconnection between a computer and a network. A **network interface** is generally **a network interface card** (**NIC**), but does not have to have a **physical** form. Instead, the network interface can be implemented in **software**.


## T

### Thread pools

Thread pools are useful when the number of threads that are created need to be limited. Using a pool not only **controls how many threads are created**, but it can also **eliminate the need to create and destroy threads repeatedly**, an often expensive operation.
