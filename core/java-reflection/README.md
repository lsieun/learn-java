- `getMethod()`: find **any `public` method**, be it `static` or `instance` that is **defined in the class** or **any of its superclasses**.
- `getDeclaredMethod()`: get **any method defined in the class**. This includes `public`, `protected`, `default access`, and even `private` methods but excludes inherited ones.
