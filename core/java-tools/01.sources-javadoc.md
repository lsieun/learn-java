# javadoc

## Basic usage

```bash
javadoc some.package
```
## Description

`javadoc` produces **documentation** from **Java source files**. It does so by reading a special comment format (known as **Javadoc comments**) and parsing it into a standard documentation format, which can then be output into a variety of document formats (although HTML is by far the most common).

## Common switches

- `-cp <classpath>`: Define the classpath to use
- `-D <directory>`: Tell javadoc where to output the generated docs
- `-quiet`: Suppress output except for errors and warnings

## Notes

The platform API docs are all written in Javadoc.

The typical way to use `javadoc` is to run it against **a whole package**, rather than just **a class**.

`javadoc` has a very large number of **switches** and **options** that can control many aspects of its behavior.
