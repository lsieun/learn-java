# jps

## Basic usage

```bash
jps 
jps <remote URL>
```

## Description

`jps` provides a list of **all active JVM processes** on the **local machine** (or **a remote machine**, if a suitable instance of `jstatd` is running on the remote side).

## Common switches

- `-m`: Output the arguments passed to the main method （Application的main方法使用的参数）
- `-v`: Output the arguments passed to the JVM （JVM使用的参数）
- `-l`: Output the full package name for the application’s `main` class (or the full path name to the application’s JAR file) （启动类的Fully Qualified Class Name）


## Notes

This command is not strictly necessary as the standard Unix `ps` command could
suffice. However, it does not use the standard Unix mechanism for interrogating the
process, so there are circumstances where a Java process stops responding (and
looks dead to jps ) but is still listed as alive by the operating system.
