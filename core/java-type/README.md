# Types

> The types of the Java programming language are divided into **two categories**: primitive types and reference types. The **primitive types** are the `boolean` type and the numeric types. The numeric types are the integral types `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, and `char`, and the floating-point types `float` and `double`. **The reference** types are class types, interface types, and array types. There is also a special null type. An object is a dynamically created instance of a class type or a dynamically created array. The values of a reference type are references to objects. All objects, including arrays, support the methods of class `Object`. String literals are represented by `String` objects.
