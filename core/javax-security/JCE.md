# Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)

URL: https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Java-Cryptography-Extension-JCE

The **J**ava **C**ryptography **E**xtension (**JCE**) is an application program interface (API) that provides **a uniform framework** for the implementation of **security features** in Java. It was originally developed to supplement the Java 2 Software Developer's Kit (SDK), Standard Edition, versions 1.2.x and 1.3.x, but has since been integrated into the Java 2 SDK, version 1.4.

The **JCE** architecture is **provider-based**, and new applications can be added seamlessly. JCE supports several applications in digital security, such as the following:

- Symmetric ciphers
- Asymmetric ciphers
- Stream ciphers
- Block ciphers
- Key generation
- Key storage
- Key retrieval
- Secure streams
- Sealed objects
- Digital signatures
- Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms
