# Java Service Provider Interface

# 1. Overview

Java 6 has introduced a feature for discovering and loading implementations matching a given interface: **Service Provider Interface (SPI)**.

# 2. Terms and Definitions of Java SPI

Java SPI defines four main components

## 2.1. Service

A well-known set of programming interfaces and classes that provide access to some specific application functionality or feature.

## 2.2. Service Provider Interface

An interface or abstract class that acts as a proxy or an endpoint to the service.

If the service is one interface, then it is the same as a service provider interface.

**Service** and **SPI** together are well-known in the **Java Ecosystem** as **API**.

## 2.3. Service Provider

A specific implementation of the SPI. The Service Provider contains one or more concrete classes that implement or extends the service type.

A Service Provider is configured and identified through a provider configuration file which we put in the resource directory `META-INF/services`. The file name is the fully-qualified name of the SPI and his content is the fully-qualified name of the SPI implementation.

The Service Provider is installed in the form of extensions, a jar file which we place in the application classpath, the java extension classpath or user-defined classpath.

## 2.4. ServiceLoader

At the heart of the SPI is the `ServiceLoader` class. This has the role of discovering and loading implementations lazily. It uses the context classpath to locate providers implementations and put them in an internal cache.
