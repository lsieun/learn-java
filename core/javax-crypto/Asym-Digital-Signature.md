# What is a Digital Signature?

## 1. Uses of digital signatures

**Digital signatures** are used to meet **three important goals** of information security: **integrity**, **authentication**, and **non-repudiation**. 

### 1.1 Data integrity

**Message or Data integrity** is particularly crucial during **data transfers**. Data integrity ensures that **the message received by the recipient** is exactly the same **message sent by the sender**. 

> 这段理解出2个意思：  
> （1）数据的完整性，保证 发送的数据 与 接收的数据 是一样的。  
> （2）数据的完整性，在data transfer过程中尤为重要。

In wide area networks(WAN，广域网) like the Internet, where messages have to hop from one node or network device to another before arriving at their intended final destination, there's always that risk of messages getting altered along the way whether deliberately or accidentally. 

> 数据在传输过程中，面临被修改的风险。

Data integrity mechanisms help mitigate those risks. Through a data integrity check, you'll know if the message you received has been tampered.

> 数据的完整性，免除上述的风险。

### 1.2 Authentication

When you receive a sensitive file, it's sometimes not enough to know that the information in that file has been unaltered. 

> 只是保证数据的完整性，是不够的。

You would also want to be sure whether it really came from the person who you think sent it. In other words, you would need a mechanism that would enable you to authenticate the source.

> 还应该保证数据的“真实性”，需要由某种机制来实现“真实性”的验证。所谓“真实性”，就是不能冒名顶替别人发送信息。

For example, let's say you received a list of your top managers accompanied by a request for their corresponding salaries. It would be wise to authenticate the source of that request first before sending out an appropriate response. You wouldn't want to be sending out that information to unauthorized personnel or to a competitor.

### 1.3 Non-repudiation

Lastly, there may be data exchanges where you wouldn't want senders to disown transmissions they actually sent some time in the past. For example, if someone submits a report and the report is later found to be fraudulent, you wouldn't want the sender to deny the fact that he sent it.

So how do digital signatures help you achieve these information security goals? Perhaps it would be best to start by explaining how they work.


## 2. How digital signatures work

**Cryptographic digital signatures** make use of **asymmetric encryption keys**, i.e. public keys and their corresponding private keys (a.k.a. secret keys). The private key is used to create a digital signature (in other words, for "signing"), while the public encryption key is used for verifying the digital signature. What makes this work is the fact that a pair of public and private keys are so closely linked with one another that it would be virtually impossible for a public key to authenticate a signature generated by a private key that it isn't associated with.

So **how does one create a digital signature?**

To create **a digital signature**, you would take **the message or file** you would like to sign and run it through **a hash function**. After that, you take **the resulting message digest or hash**, combine it with **your private key**, and then run them through **a signing algorithm** like **RSA** or **DSA**. **The final result** is that **message's digital signature**.  

> 这里讲述了digital signature的生成过程

Theoretically, you could skip that **hash function** part and simply run the file and the private key through some "signing algorithm" and still produce a "digital signature". However, if the file is so large, this would take a great deal of time. Besides, the resulting "signature" would also consume an impractically huge amount of space. 

> 这里讲述了hash function的必要性  
> 上面的内容讲述了，生成digital signature的过程，要用到private key  
> 下面的内容讲述了，如何利用digital signature来验证数据的“真实性”和“完整性”，要用到public key

How about **the digital signature** **verification process**? This process now involves **the secret key's public key pair**. While **the secret key** is used to **sign** documents, its corresponding **public key** is used for **verifying** their authenticity. Remember when I told you that the public key is tightly linked to its private key?

> digital signature 与 key pair的关系：  
> private key 用于 sign，来生成digital signature  
> public key 用于 verify，从digital signature中获取 message digest

If you have a public key and the key fails to authenticate a document you just received, that would mean the secret key used for signing wasn't this public key's pair. Consequently, it would also mean that the document's source isn't who you expected it to be. That's how digital signatures are used for **authentication**.

During the same verification process, the public key is also used to extract the message digest that was originally combined with the private key to produce the digital signature. The retrieved message digest is then compared with the recipient's own locally-generated hash value of the received message. The recipient must know **what hash function was used** by the sender. If the locally-generated hash value and the extracted message digest are equal, then it would mean that **integrity** of the message has been preserved. 

> 这里是测试数据的完整性 Data integrity

Here's a simplified illustration of what we just discussed:

![](images/hashing-digital-signature.png)


Let me just go over those steps:

1. At the source (in this case, a server), the document is run through **a hash function** (e.g. SHA2 hashing algorithm) to produce **a hash** a.k.a. **message digest**. **The message digest** is combined with **the source's private key** to produce **the document's digital signature**. 

2. The **digital signature** is affixed to **the document** and both are sent to the recipient (in this case, a client application). 

3. At the client side, **the message digest** is extracted from **the digital signature** using a copy of **the server's public key** that's in the client's possession. Note that the client wouldn't be able to extract the message digest if the public key in its possession doesn't match the private key used to generate the digital signature.

4. The client runs the document through **the same hash function** used by the sender to produce its own **locally-generated hash**.

5. The two hashes are compared. 

If the two hashes are equal, it would prove **two things**: 1. that the document was unaltered (thereby achieving **integrity**) and 2. that the source is who the recipient expected it to be (thereby achieving **authentication**). 

If both are achieved, then there is **no way the sender can later on deny** that he sent the document. That's because none of these would be achieved if the wrong private key was used in step 1. Since only the source could (theoretically) have a hold of the private key, only the source could have initiated this particular transaction. And that is how digital signatures help establish **non-repudiation**. 

Its ability to help enforce **authentication**, **data integrity**, and **non-repudiation** can be very useful in automated business transactions and is the reason why digital signatures are integral to secure data transfer protocols like SFTP, FTPS, OFTP, and AS2. 

## 3. When digital signatures alone are not enough

Notice how digital signatures are very dependent on the integrity of the encryption keys. What if the public key in your possession actually belongs to an impostor? It's possible for an attacker to pose as someone else and then dupe you into obtaining his (the attacker's) public key. Once that happens, the entire process illustrated earlier (from step 1 through 5) will proceed as normal even if (in actuality) it has already been compromised.

In our next post, you'll learn how to mitigate this particular risk by using digital certificates, certificate authorities, and other trust models.
