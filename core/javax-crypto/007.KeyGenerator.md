# Java KeyGenerator

The Java `KeyGenerator` class (`javax.crypto.KeyGenerator`) is used to generate **symmetric encryption keys**. **A symmetric encryption key** is a key that is used for both **encryption** and **decryption** of data, by a **symmetric encryption algorithm**. In this Java KeyGenerator tutorial I will show you how to generate symmetric encryption keys.

## 1. Creating a KeyGenerator Instance

Before you can use the Java `KeyGenerator` class you must create a `KeyGenerator` instance. You create a `KeyGenerator` instance by calling the static method `getInstance()` passing as parameter **the name of the encryption algorithm** to create a key for. Here is an example of creating a Java KeyGenerator instance:

```java
KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
```

This example creates a `KeyGenerator` instance which can generate keys for the `AES` encryption algorithm.

## 2. Initializing the KeyGenerator

After creating the `KeyGenerator` instance you must initialize it. Initializing a `KeyGenerator` instance is done by calling its `init()` method. Here is an example of initializing a KeyGenerator instance:

```java
SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
int keyBitSize = 256;

keyGenerator.init(keyBitSize, secureRandom);
```

The KeyGenerator `init()` method takes **two parameters**: **The bit size of the keys** to generate, and a `SecureRandom` that is used during key generation.

## 3. Generating a Key

Once the Java `KeyGenerator` instance is initialized you can use it to generate keys. Generating a key is done by calling the KeyGenerator `generateKey()` method. Here is an example of generating **a symmetric key**:

```java
SecretKey secretKey = keyGenerator.generateKey();
```
