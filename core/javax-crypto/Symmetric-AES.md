# Advanced Encryption Standard

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard

The **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.

**AES** has been adopted by the **U.S. government** and is now used **worldwide**. It supersedes the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**, which was published in 1977. The algorithm described by **AES** is a **symmetric-key algorithm**, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
