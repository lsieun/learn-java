## 1. Strongly typed languages

A **strongly-typed language** is one in which variables are bound to specific data types, and will result in type errors if types do not match up as expected in the expression — regardless of when type checking occurs.

### 1.1. Example

Python is strong-typed, and so is Java.

#### 1.1.1. Python Example

```python
temp = “Hello World!”
temp = temp + 10; # program terminates with below stated error
```

错误输出：

```txt
temp = temp + 10;
TypeError: cannot concatenate ‘str’ and ‘int’ objects
```

In the above example, `temp` is of `str` type. In the second line, we tried attempting to add `10` (an `int`) to a variable of `str` type. As we can see, a `TypeError` is returned, indicating that a `str` object cannot be concatenated with an `int` object. This is what characterizes strong typed languages: **variables are bound to a particular data type**.

## 2. Weakly typed languages

A weakly-typed language on the other hand is a language in which variables are not bound to a specific data type; they still have a type, but type safety constraints are lower compared to strongly-typed languages.

### 2.1. Example

PHP is weakly-typed, and so is C.

#### PHP Example

```php
$temp = “Hello World!”;
$temp = $temp + 10; // no error caused
echo $temp;
```

In this example, variable `temp` is initially a `string` type. In the second line, we add this `string` variable to `10`, an `integer`. This is permitted in PHP, and is characteristic of all weakly-typed languages.

#### Javascript Example

```html
<html>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var value1 = "11";
        var value2 = value1 + 1;
        alert(value2); // 111
        var value3 = value1 - 1;
        alert(value3); // 10
    </script>
</html>
```
