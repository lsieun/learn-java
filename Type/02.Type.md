# Type


从“静”和“动”两个视角，来解读Type和Variable之间的关系：Type是“静”，它包含了一系列的value和一系列的operator，而Variable是“动”，它只能代表一个value。

## Why have type

**Assigning a data type**, termed **typing**, gives meaning to **a sequence of bits** such as a value in memory or some object such as a variable. The hardware of a general purpose computer is unable to discriminate between for example *a memory address* and *an instruction code*, or between a character, an integer, or a floating-point number, because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that a sequence of bits might mean. Associating **a sequence of bits** with **a type** conveys that meaning to the programmable hardware to form a **symbolic system** composed of that hardware and some program.

这段理解：

- （1） 过去，我一直不理解typing和typed到底要表达什么意思。现在，看到typing，我明白了，它是一个“过程”，是给一段比特值（a sequence of bits）赋予类型（type）的过程。
- （2） 在引入type概念之前，hardware无法对memory address和instruction code进行区分，只能视为a sequence of bits。
- （3） 在引入type概念之后，hardware才能对不同的sequence of bits区分出不同的含义。

## 1. What is a type?

### 1.1. A set of values and the valid operations on those values

- Integers: `+`， `-`， `*`， `/`， `<`， `<=`， `=`， `>=`， `>` ...
- Arrays:
  - `lookUp(<array>,<index>)`
  - `assign(<array>,<index>,<value>)`
  - `initialize(<array>)`, `setBounds(<array>)`
- User-defined types:
  - Java interfaces

### 1.3. Views of Types

- Set point of view: 集合视角（“值”的集合）
  - int = {1,-2,... }
  - char = {‘a’,’b’,...}
  - list = { (), (a (2 b) ), ... }
- Abstraction point of view: 抽象视角（“操作”的集合）
  - Set of operations which can be combined meaningfully e.g., Java interfaces
- Constructive point of view: 构建视角（“”）
  - Primitive types e.g., int, char, bool, enum{red,green,yellow}
  - Composite/constructed types:
    - reference e.g., pointerTo(int)
    - array e.g., arrayOf(char) or arrayOf(char,20) or ...
    - record/structure e.g., record(age:int, name:string)
    - subrange e.g., int[1..20] or color[red..green]
    - union e.g. union(int, pointerTo(char))
    - list e.g., list(...)
    - set e.g., setOf(color) or setOf(int[10..20])
    - function e.g., float --> int

为了更方便的理解Constructive point of view，可以如下这样对比思考。

五行，金、木、水、火、土，可以构成宇宙中万事万物。换句话说，任何一种我们看到的东西都可以分解成金、木、水、火、土这五种元素。

在Java语言当中，所谓的primitive types（int, char, long, double等），就是最基础的类型，它们所扮演的角色就类似于“五行元素”。换句话说，一个可以存储数据的Java Class instance经过不断分解之后，你可能会发现，它最终是由primitive types组成的。

Java provides various datatypes to store various data values. It provides 7 primitive datatypes (stores single values) as listed below −

- `boolean` − Stores 1-bit value representing true or, false.
- `byte` − Stores twos compliment integer up to 8 bits.
- `char` − Stores a Unicode character value up to 16 bits.
- `short` − Stores an integer value upto 16 bits.
- `int` − Stores an integer value upto 32 bits.
- `long` − Stores an integer value upto 64 bits.
- `float` − Stores a floating point value upto 32bits.
- `double` − Stores a floating point value up to 64 bits.

## 2. Variables

### 2.1. Type and Variable

- Implicit
  - If variables are typed by usage: Prolog, Scheme, Lisp, Smalltalk
- Explicit
  - If declarations bind types to variables at compile time: Pascal, Algol68, C, C++, Java
- Mixture
  - Implicit by default but allows explicit declarations: Haskell, ML, Common Lisp

#### 2.1.1. Python Example

Python sets the **variable type** based on the **value** that is assigned to it. Unlike more riggers languages, Python will change the **variable type** if the variable value is set to another value. For example:

```python
var = 123 # This will create a number integer assignment
var = 'john' # the `var` variable is now a string type.
```

```python
>>> value = 100
>>> type(value)
<class 'int'>
>>> value = "abc"
>>> type(value)
<class 'str'>
```

#### 2.1.2. Java Example

```java
int i = 10;
String str = "ABC";
```

一个类比。在中世纪的欧洲，有两种类型的士兵，一种是骑士（Knight），另一种是雇佣兵（Mercenary）。

- Knight： 骑士(in the Middle Ages) a man of high social rank who had a duty to fight for his king. （英国）爵士（其名前冠以 Sir）(in Britain) a man who has been given a special honour by the king or queen and has the title Sir before his name
- Mercenary： 雇佣兵 a soldier who will fight for any country or group that offers payment

以Java语言来说，"String str"，其中"str"就像一个人，而"String"就像是国王，那么`String str`就像是国王在向这个人授予骑士的荣誉，从此之后"str"这个人就为国王（String）效力。

以Python语言来说，`value = 100`和`value = "abc"`中的value就像一个雇佣兵，谁给他“钱”（值），他就为谁效力。

### 2.2. Variable Scope

#### 2.2.1. Lexical scoping vs. dynamic scoping

The use of local variables — of variable names with limited scope, that only exist **within** a specific function — helps avoid the risk of a name collision between two identically named variables. However, there are **two very different approaches** to answering this question: **What does it mean to be "within" a function**?

> local variables = variable names with limited scope

In **lexical scoping** (or **lexical scope**; also called **static scoping** or **static scope**), if a variable name's scope is a certain function, then **its scope** is **the program text of the function definition**: within that text, the variable name exists, and is bound to the variable's value, but outside that text, the variable name does not exist.

By contrast, in **dynamic scoping** (or **dynamic scope**), if a variable name's scope is a certain function, then **its scope** is **the time-period during which the function is executing**: while the function is running, the variable name exists, and is bound to its value, but after the function returns, the variable name does not exist.

This means that if function `f` invokes a separately defined function `g`, then under **lexical scoping**, function `g` does not have access to `f`'s local variables (assuming the text of `g` is not inside the text of `f`), while under **dynamic scoping**, function `g` does have access to `f`'s local variables (since `g` is invoked during the invocation of `f`).<sub>这里通过举例来说明两者的不同之处</sub>

Consider, for example, the program on the below. The first line, `x=1`, creates a global variable `x` and initializes it to `1`. The second line, `function g () { echo $x ; x=2 ; }`, defines a function `g` that prints out ("echoes") the current value of `x`, and then sets `x` to `2` (overwriting the previous value). The third line, `function f () { local x=3 ; g ; }` defines a function `f` that creates a local variable `x` (hiding the identically named global variable) and initializes it to `3`, and then calls `g`. The fourth line, `f`, calls `f`. The fifth line, `echo $x`, prints out the current value of `x`.

```bash
# bash language
$ x=1
$ function g () { echo $x ; x=2 ; }
$ function f () { local x=3 ; g ; }
$ f # does this print 1, or 3?
3
$ echo $x # does this print 1, or 2?
1
```

So, what exactly does this program print? It depends on **the scoping rules**. If the language of this program is one that uses **lexical scoping**, then `g` prints and modifies the global variable `x` (because `g` is defined outside `f`), so the program prints `1` and then `2`. By contrast, if this language uses **dynamic scoping**, then `g` prints and modifies `f`'s local variable `x` (because `g` is called from within `f`), so the program prints `3` and then `1`. (As it happens, the language of the program is **Bash**, which uses **dynamic scoping**; so the program prints `3` and then `1`.)

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    static int x = 1;

    static void g() {
        System.out.println("x = " + x);
        x = 2;
    }

    static void f() {
        int x = 3;
        g();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        f();
        System.out.println("x = " + x);
    }
}
```

Output:

```txt
x = 1
x = 2
```

## 2.3. Type conversion

Converting one primitive datatype into another is known as **type casting** (**type conversion**) in Java. You can cast the primitive datatypes in two ways namely, **Widening** and, **Narrowing**.

**Widening** − Converting a lower datatype to a higher datatype is known as widening. In this case the casting/conversion is done automatically therefore, it is known as implicit type casting. In this case both datatypes should be compatible with each other.

**Narrowing** − Converting a higher datatype to a lower datatype is known as narrowing. In this case the casting/conversion is not done automatically, you need to convert explicitly using the cast operator “( )” explicitly. Therefore, it is known as **explicit type casting**. In this case both datatypes need not be compatible with each other.

### 2.3.1. Implicit conversion

### 2.3.2. Explicit conversion

### Coercion

Coercion is an automatic conversion of a type of data element to another type of data element for computation such that the information is not lost. For example, integer value 1 can be coerced to floating point value 1.0 without loss of any information. However, if we try to convert a floating point number to an integer, then information may be lost, and it will be casting and not coercion.
