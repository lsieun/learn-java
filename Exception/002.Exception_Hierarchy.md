## 1. Exception Classes - Throwable, Error, Exception & RuntimeException

The figure ‎below shows the hierarchy of the Exception classes. The base class for all Exception objects is `java.lang.Throwable`, together with its two subclasses `java.lang.Exception` and `java.lang.Error`.

![](images/Exception_Classes.png)

- The `Error` class describes internal system errors (e.g., `VirtualMachineError`, `LinkageError`) that rarely occur. If such an error occurs, there is little that you can do and the program will be terminated by the Java runtime.
- The `Exception` class describes the error caused by your program (e.g. `FileNotFoundException`, `IOException`). These errors could be caught and handled by your program (e.g., perform an alternate action or do a graceful exit by closing all the files, network and database connections).

As illustrated, the subclasses of `Error` and `RuntimeException` are known as **unchecked exceptions**. These exceptions are not checked by the compiler, and hence, need not be caught or declared to be thrown in your program. This is because there is not much you can do with these exceptions. For example, a "divide by 0" triggers an `ArithmeticException`, array index out-of-bound triggers an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException`, which are really **programming logical errors** that shall be been fixed in compiled-time, rather than leaving it to runtime exception handling.

All the other exception are called **checked exceptions**. They are checked by the compiler and must be caught or declared to be thrown.

下面的说法，我觉得很不错：

- An `Error` is a **serious error** that was caused by a **logic error** in the program; for example, running out of memory. Programs should usually not catch Errors. Rather, if an Error occurs, the programmer should find the cause and fix the program.
- An `Exception` is typically an error caused by **circumstances outside the program's control**. For example, if the program tries to read from a file, and the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundException` will be thrown. These are called **checked exceptions**, because Java requires the program to catch or otherwise deal with them.
- A `RuntimeException` is typically caused by a **logic error in the program**, such as referencing a nonexistent object (a `NullPointerException`) or using an illegal index into an array (an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds`). Although `RuntimeException` is a subclass of `Exception`, runtime exceptions are **unchecked exceptions**; no special code is required to deal with them.

下面是比较Error和RuntimeException两者之间的区别：

Both `Error` and `RuntimeException` are **unchecked exceptions**, meaning that it indicate **a flaw with the program**, and usually should not be caught. (`NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, etc.)

I think the main difference between the two is that `RuntimeException` indicate there is a error with the program, and an `Error` is something that is fatal but out of the program's control. (`OutOfMemorryError`, `ThreadDeath`, etc.)

Therefore **subclassing an `Error` is bad practice** because an error is usually not something that could be fixed by your program at runtime. In your program, should you need to throw something, use an Exception.

You've already mentioned the main differences. The Java Language Specification says the same thing in different terms. For `Error`, it states

- `Error` is the superclass of all the exceptions from which ordinary programs are **not ordinarily expected to recover**.

For `RuntimeException`, it states

- The class `RuntimeException` is a direct subclass of `Exception`. `RuntimeException` is the superclass of all the exceptions which may be thrown for many reasons during expression evaluation, but from which **recovery may still be possible**.

Throwable is at the top off all exceptions. Underneath Throwable you have Error and Exception. Underneath Exception you have RuntimeException.

Java has two types of exceptions - checked and unchecked. Checked exceptions are enforced by the compiler (you have to declare them in the throws clause and catch them eventually). Unchecked exceptions are not enforced for catching or declaring in throws clause.

(Controversial part of the answer)

Throwable exists so that there is a parent for all exception types. You should never declare that you throw Throwable and never catch it (unless you really really really know what you are doing).

`Error` exists to indicate **issues with the runtime environment**, things that your program probably cannot recover from, such as a badly formatted class file or the VM running out of memory. You should not catch an Error unless you really know what you are doing.

`Exception` exists as the root for **all non-programmer errors** (see `RuntimeException` for the "exception" to this) , such as a file cannot be created because the disk is full. You should not throw, throws, or catch Exception. If you have to catch Exception make sure you know what you are doing.

`RuntimeException` exists to indicate all programmer error, such as going past the end of an array or calling a method on a null object. These are things that you should fix so that they do not throw exceptions - the indicate that **you, the programmer, screwed up the code**. Again, you should not catch these unless you know what you are doing.

Why these many types? Instead Java may simply follow a simple design(just try/catch all types) to handle an abnormal condition in a program?

Why? Because they are necessary! Without those 4 classes, handling exceptions by broad category would be impractical.

- How would you catch "all fatal JVM errors" without the Error class?
- How would you catch "all exceptions that are not JVM fatal errors" without the Exception class?
- How would you catch "all unchecked exceptions" without the RuntimeException class?

Why are these many types?

In addition to Stephen C's answer I want to say: **exception handling is a relatively expensive operation in Java**. We should not put all exceptional situation in a try/catch block. **Excessive use of try/catchs may hamper program performance**.

In conclusion, `Exception`s should be handled programmatically whenever possible. On the other hand, we cannot handle `Error`s, so these might be some logical reasons why there are many types of exceptions.

## 2. Checked Exceptions

Checked Exceptions are the exceptions that we can typically foresee and plan ahead in our application. These are also exceptions that the Java Compiler requires us to either **handle-or-declare** when writing code.

The **handle-or-declare** rule refers to our responsibility to either **declare that a method throws an exception up the call stack** - without doing much to prevent it or **handle the exception with our own code**, which typically leads to the recovery of the program from the exceptional condition.

This is the reason why they're called **checked exceptions**. The compiler can detect them before runtime, and you're aware of their potential existence while writing code.

## 3. Unchecked Exceptions

Unchecked Exceptions are the exceptions that typically occur due to human, rather than an environmental error. These exceptions are not checked during compile-time, but at runtime, which is the reason they're also called **Runtime Exceptions**.

They can often be countered by implementing **simple checks** before a segment of code that could potentially be used in a way that forms a runtime exception.<sub>处理Exception的最好的办法就是：写代码，要事前多检查，避免事后出异常</sub>

## 4. Errors

Errors are the most serious exceptional conditions that you can run into. They are often irrecoverable from and there's no real way to handle them. The only thing we, as developers, can do is optimize the code in hopes that the errors never occur.

Errors can occur due to human and environmental errors. Creating an infinitely recurring method can lead to a `StackOverflowError`, or a memory leak can lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`.
