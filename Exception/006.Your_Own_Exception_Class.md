# Creating Your Own Exception Classes

You should try to reuse the `Exception` classes provided in the JDK, e.g., `IndexOutOfBoundException`, `ArithmeticException`, `IOException`, and `IllegalArugmentException`. But you can always create you own `Exception` classes by extending from the class Exception or one of its subclasses.

**Note** that `RuntimeException` and its subclasses are not checked by the compiler and need not be declared in the method's signature. Therefore, use them with care, as you will not be informed and may not be aware of the exceptions that may occur by using that method (and therefore do not have the proper exception handling codes) â€“ a bad software engineering practice.

```java
// Create our own exception class by subclassing Exception. This is a checked exception
public class MyMagicException extends Exception {
   public MyMagicException(String message) {  //constructor
      super(message);
   }
}
```

```java
public class MyMagicExceptionTest {
   // This method "throw MyMagicException" in its body.
   // MyMagicException is checked and need to be declared in the method's signature 
   public static void magic(int number) throws MyMagicException {
      if (number == 8) {
         throw (new MyMagicException("you hit the magic number"));
      }
      System.out.println("hello");  // skip if exception triggered
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try {
         magic(9);   // does not trigger exception
         magic(8);   // trigger exception
      } catch (MyMagicException ex) {   // exception handler
         ex.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
}
```

The output is as follows:

```txt
hello
MyMagicException: you hit the magic number
        at MyMagicExceptionTest.magic(MyMagicExceptionTest.java:6)
        at MyMagicExceptionTest.main(MyMagicExceptionTest.java:14)
```
