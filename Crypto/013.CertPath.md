# Java CertPath

The Java `CertPath` class (`java.security.cert.CertPath` represents **a chain of cryptographic identity certificates** (Java `Certificate` objects), where each certificate is the digital signer of the next certificate in the chain. The Java `CertPath` class is typically used to verify an identity certificate along with the certificates of the **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** that signed the certificate.

## 1. Obtaining a CertPath Instance

You will typically obtain a Java `CertPath` instance from a `CertificateFactory` or a `CertPathBuilder`. See the Java CertificateFactory tutorial for information about obtaining a CertPath instance.

## 2. getCertificates()

Once you have a Java `CertPath` instance you can obtain the `Certificate` instances the CertPath consists of by calling the CertPath `getCertificates()` method. Here is an example of obtaining the certificates from a CertPath instance:

```java
List<Certificate> certificates = certPath.getCertificates();
```

## 3. getType()

The CertPath `getType()` method returns a string telling **what type of certificates** (e.g. **X.509**) this CertPath instance contains. Here is an example of obtaining the CertPath type via getType():

```java
String type = certPath.getType();
```
