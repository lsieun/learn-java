# Java IO and NIO

## Introduction

Sockets use TCP/IP transport protocol. You do not usually have to deal with them since there are protocols built on top of them like HTTP or FTP; however, it is important to know how they work.

> TCP: It is a reliable data transfer protocol that ensures that the data sent is complete and correct and requires to establish a connection.

Java offers a blocking and non-blocking alternative to create sockets, and depending on your requirements, you might consider the one or the other.

## Java Blocking IO

## Java NIO

`java.nio` is a non-blocking API for socket connections, which means you are not tight to the number of threads available. With this library, one thread can handle multiple connections at once.

Main elements:

- **Channel**: channels are a combination of input and output streams, so they allow you to read and write, and they use buffers to do these operations.
- **Buffer**: it is a block of memory used to read from a Channel and write into it. When you want to read data from a Buffer, you need to invoke `flip()`, so that it will set `pos` to `0`.
- **Selector**: A Selector can register multiple Channels and will check which ones are ready for accepting new connections. Similar to `accept()` method of blocking IO, when `select()` is invoked, it will block the application until a Channel is ready to do an operation. Because a Selector can register many channels, only one thread is required to handle multiple connections.
- **Selection Key**: It contains properties for a particular Channel (interest set, ready set, selector/channel, and an optional attached object). Selection keys are mainly used to know the current interest of the channel (`isAcceptable()`, `isReadable()`, `isWritable()`), get the channel and do operations with that channel.
