# Java SE and Java EE applications

## 1. Overview

Basically Java can Categories into Three parts:

- Java SE (Core Java or Java Core)
- Java EE (Advance Java)
- Java ME (Mobile Development with Java)

1. **Java SE (Core Java)** : Java SE is used for **Developing Standalone application Or System Software** that Run on System only. In The Java SE you can Learn the Basic of Java Like: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Strings etc.

2. **Java EE (Advance Java)** : Java EE is used for **developing Web Applications** that Run with the help of Web Browser. In Java EE you can Learn the Advance topics Like: Servlet, Java Server pages(JSP), Enterprise Java Beans(EJB) etc.

3. **Java ME (Mobile Development with Java)** : Java ME is used for Developing Mobile Application That Run on The Mobile Phones. In The Java ME basically you Learn about Android App Development.

## 2. API


**Java SE** = **Standard Edition**. This is the core Java programming platform. It contains all of the libraries and APIs that any Java programmer should learn (`java.lang`, `java.io`, `java.math`, `java.net`, `java.util`, etc...).

**Java EE** = `Enterprise Edition`. From Wikipedia:

> The Java platform (Enterprise Edition) differs from the Java Standard Edition Platform (Java SE) in that it adds libraries which provide functionality to deploy **fault-tolerant, distributed, multi-tier Java software**, based largely on modular components running on an application server.

In other words, if your application demands a very large scale, distributed system, then you should consider using Java EE. Built on top of Java SE, it provides libraries for **database access** (JDBC, JPA), **remote method invocation** (RMI), **messaging** (JMS), **web services**, **XML processing**, and defines standard APIs for Enterprise **JavaBeans**, **servlets**, **portlets**, **Java Server Pages**, etc...

Here are some differences in terms of APIs

Java SE includes has the following APIs and many more

- applet
- awt
- rmi
- jdbc
- swing
- collections
- xml binding
- JavaFX (Merged to Java SE 8)
- Java 8 Streaming

Java EE includes the following APIs and many more

- servlet
- websocket
- java faces
- dependency injection
- ejb
- persistence
- transaction
- jms
- batch api
