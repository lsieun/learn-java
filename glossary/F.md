## FQCN

**FQCN** stands for **F**ully-**Q**ualified **C**lass **N**ame 

Example:

The `java.lang` package is imported automatically into all source files. In case there are two or more classes with the same name but defined in different imported (or assumed) packages, then those classes must be referenced by their **fully-qualified-class-name** (**FQCN**).
