## Flat File

A **flat file**, also known as a **text database**, is a type of database that stores data in a plain text format. Flat file databases were developed and implemented in the early 1970s by IBM.

A flat file features a table with a single record per line. The different columns in a record use a tab or comma to delimit the fields. The flat file database does not have multiple tables, unlike in a relational database. The information contained in flat files does not have associated paths or folders.

## FQCN

**FQCN** stands for **F**ully-**Q**ualified **C**lass **N**ame.

Example:

The `java.lang` package is imported automatically into all source files. In case there are two or more classes with the same name but defined in different imported (or assumed) packages, then those classes must be referenced by their **fully-qualified-class-name** (**FQCN**).
