## glob (programming)

In computer programming, **glob** patterns specify sets of filenames with **wildcard characters**. For example, the Unix command `mv *.txt textfiles/` moves (mv) all files with names ending in `.txt` from the current directory to the directory `textfiles`. Here, `*` is a wildcard standing for "any string of characters" and `*.txt` is a glob pattern. The other common wildcard is the question mark (`?`), which stands for one character.

The **glob** command, short for global, originates in the earliest versions of Bell Labs' Unix. Later, this functionality was provided as a library function, `glob()`, used by programs such as the shell.

## Wild card (cards)

A **wild card** in card games is one that may be used to represent any other playing card, sometimes with certain restrictions. A card which is not **wild** may be referred to as a **natural card**.
