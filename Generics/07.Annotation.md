# Generics and annotations

It is worth mentioning that in the pre-Java 8 era the generics were not allowed to have annotations associated with their type parameters. But Java 8 changed that and now it becomes possible to annotate generics type parameters at the places they are declared or used.

For example, here is how the generic method could be declared and its type parameter is adorned with annotations:

```java
public<@Actionable T> void performAction(final T action) {
    // Some implementation here
}
```

Or just another example of applying the annotation when generic type is being used:

```java
final Collection<@NotEmpty String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
// Some implementation here
```
