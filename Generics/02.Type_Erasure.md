# Type Erasure

We know that the Java platform has a strong preference for **backward compatibility**. The addition of generics in Java 5 was another example of where **backward compatibility** was an issue for a new language feature.

**The central question** was how to make a type system that allowed older, nongeneric collection classes to be used alongside with newer, generic collections. The design decision was to achieve this by the use of casts:

```java
List someThings = getSomeThings();
// Unsafe cast, but we know that the
// contents of someThings are really strings
List<String> myStrings = (List<String>)someThings;
```

This means that `List` and `List<String>` are compatible as types, at least at some level. Java achieves this compatibility by **type erasure**. This means that **generic type parameters** are only visible at **compile time**—they are stripped out by `javac` and are not reflected in the **bytecode**.

**The mechanism of type erasure** gives rise to a difference in the type system seen by `javac` and that seen by the **JVM**.

## Limitation

Type erasure also prohibits some other definitions, which would otherwise seem legal. In this code, we want to count the orders as represented in two slightly different data structures:

```java
// Won't compile
interface OrderCounter {
    // Name maps to list of order numbers
    int totalOrders(Map<String, List<String>> orders);
    // Name maps to total orders made so far
    int totalOrders(Map<String, Integer> orders);
}
```

This seems like perfectly legal Java code, but it will not compile. The issue is that although the two methods seem like normal overloads, after **type erasure**, the signature of both methods becomes:

```java
int totalOrders(Map);
```

All that is left after type erasure is the raw type of the container—in this case, `Map`. The runtime would be unable to distinguish between the methods by signature, and so the language specification makes this syntax illegal.
