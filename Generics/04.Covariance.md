**The design of Java’s generics** contains the solution to **an old problem**.

## 1. Array Covariance

In the earliest versions of Java, before the collections libraries were even introduced, the language had been forced to confront a deep­seated type system design issue.

Put simply, the question is this:

- Should **an array of strings** be compatible with a variable of type **array­ of­ object**?

In other words, should this code be legal?

```java
String[] words = {"Hello World!"};
Object[] objects = words;
```

Without this, then even simple methods like `Arrays::sort` would have been very difficult to write in a useful way, as this would not work as expected:

```java
Arrays.sort(Object[] a);
```

The method declaration would only work for the type `Object[]` and not for any other array type. As a result of these complications, the very first version of the Java Language Standard determined that:

- If a value of type `C` can be assigned to a variable of type `P` then a value of type `C[]` can be assigned to a variable of type `P[]`.

That is, **arrays’ assignment syntax** varies with **the base type** that they hold, or **arrays** are **covariant**.

This design decision is rather unfortunate, as it leads to immediate negative consequences:

```java
String[] words = {"Hello", "World!"};
Object[] objects = words;

// Oh, dear, runtime error
objects[0] = new Integer(42);
```

The assignment to `objects[0]` attempts to store an `Integer` into a piece of storage that is expecting to hold a `String`. This obviously will not work, and will throw an `ArrayStoreException`.

**The usefulness of covariant arrays** led to them being seen as **a necessary evil** in the very early days of the platform, despite the hole in the static type system that the feature exposes.

However, more recent research on modern open source codebases indicates that **array covariance is extremely rarely used** and is a language misfeature. **You should avoided it when writing new code**.

## 2. Generics Covariance

When considering the behavior of generics in the Java platform, a very similar question can be asked: “Is `List<String>` a subtype of `List<Object>`?” That is, can we write this:

```java
// Is this legal?
List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<String>();
```

At first glance, this seems entirely reasonable—`String` is a subclass of `Object`, so we know that any `String` element in our collection is also a valid `Object`.

However, consider the following code (which is just the **array covariance** code translated to use `List`):

```java
// Is this legal?
List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<String>();

// What do we do about this?
objects.add(new Object());
```

As the type of `objects` was declared to be `List<Object>`, then it should be legal to add an `Object` instance to it. However, as the actual instance holds strings, then trying to add an `Object` would not be compatible, and so this would fail at runtime.

This would have changed nothing from the case of arrays, and so the resolution is to realize that although this is legal:

```java
Object o = new String("X");
```

that does not mean that the corresponding statement for generic container types is also true, and as a result:

```java
// Won't compile
List<Object> objects = new ArrayList<String>();
```

Another way of saying this is that `List<String>` is not a subtype of `List<Object>` or that **generic types are invariant, not covariant**. We will have more to say about this when we discuss **bounded wildcards**.
