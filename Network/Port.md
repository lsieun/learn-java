# Port

Port numbers range from `0` to `65535`.

Port numbers are broken down into **three types**:

- **Well-known ports** (`0` to `1023`): These are port numbers that are used for relatively common services.
- **Registered ports** (`1024` to `49151`): These are port numbers that are assigned by IANA to a process.
- **Dynamic/private ports** (`49152` to `65535`): These are dynamically assigned to clients when a connection is initiated. These are normally temporary and cannot be assigned by IANA.
