# Writing Request Data to a Server

Sometimes you need to write data to a `URLConnection`, for example, when you submit a form to a web server using `POST` or upload a file using `PUT`. The `getOutputStream()` method returns an `OutputStream` on which you can write data for transmission to a server:

```java
public OutputStream getOutputStream()
```

A `URLConnection` doesn’t allow output by default, so you have to call `setDoOutput(true)` before asking for an output stream. When you set `doOutput` to `true` for an http URL, the request method is changed from `GET` to `POST`.

Once you have an `OutputStream`, buffer it by chaining it to a `BufferedOutputStream` or a `BufferedWriter`. You may also chain it to a `DataOutputStream`, an `OutputStreamWriter`, or some other class that’s more convenient to use than a raw `OutputStream`.

```java
try {
    URL u = new URL("http://www.somehost.com/cgi-bin/acgi");
    // open the connection and prepare it to POST
    URLConnection uc = u.openConnection();
    uc.setDoOutput(true);
    OutputStream raw = uc.getOutputStream();
    OutputStream buffered = new BufferedOutputStream(raw);
    OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(buffered, "8859_1");
    out.write("first=Julie&middle=&last=Harting&work=String+Quartet\r\n");
    out.flush();
    out.close();
} catch (IOException ex) {
    System.err.println(ex);
}
```

Sending data with `POST` is almost as easy as with `GET`. Invoke `setDoOutput(true)` and use the `URLConnection`’s `getOutputStream()` method to write the query string rather than attaching it to the URL. **Java buffers all the data written onto the output stream until the stream is closed**. This enables it to calculate the value for the `Content-length` header.

The `getOutputStream()` method is also used for the `PUT` request method, a means of storing files on a web server. The data to be stored is written onto the `OutputStream` that `getOutputStream()` returns. However, this can be done only from within the `HttpURLConnection` subclass of `URLConnection`, so discussion of `PUT` will have to wait a little while.
