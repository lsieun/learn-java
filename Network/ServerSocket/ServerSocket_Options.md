# Socket Options

Socket options specify how the native sockets on which the `ServerSocket` class relies send and receive data. For server sockets, Java supports three options:

- SO_TIMEOUT
- SO_REUSEADDR
- SO_RCVBUF

It also allows you to set performance preferences for the socket’s packets.

## SO_TIMEOUT

`SO_TIMEOUT` is the amount of time, in **milliseconds**, that `accept()` waits for an incoming connection before throwing a `java.io.InterruptedIOException`. If `SO_TIMEOUT` is `0`, `accept()` will never time out. The default is to never time out.

Setting `SO_TIMEOUT` is uncommon. You might need it if you were implementing a complicated and secure protocol that required multiple connections between the client and the server where responses needed to occur within a fixed amount of time. However, most servers are designed to run for indefinite periods of time and therefore just use the default timeout value, `0` (never time out). If you want to change this, the `setSoTimeout()` method sets the `SO_TIMEOUT` field for this server socket object:

```java
public void setSoTimeout(int timeout) throws SocketException
public int getSoTimeout() throws IOException
```

The countdown starts when `accept()` is invoked. When the timeout expires, `accept()` throws a `SocketTimeoutException`, a subclass of `IOException`. You need to set this option before calling `accept()`; you cannot change the timeout value while `accept()` is waiting for a connection. The timeout argument must be greater than or equal to zero; if it isn’t, the method throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. For example:

```java
try (ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(port)) {
    server.setSoTimeout(30000); // block for no more than 30 seconds
    try {
        Socket s = server.accept();
        // handle the connection
        // ...
    } catch (SocketTimeoutException ex) {
        System.err.println("No connection within 30 seconds");
    }
} catch (IOException ex) {
    System.err.println("Unexpected IOException: " + ex);
}
```

The `getSoTimeout()` method returns this server socket’s current `SO_TIMEOUT` value. For example:

```java
public void printSoTimeout(ServerSocket server) throws IOException {
    int timeout = server.getSoTimeout();
    if (timeout > 0) {
        System.out.println(server + " will time out after "
                + timeout + "milliseconds.");
    } else if (timeout == 0) {
        System.out.println(server + " will never time out.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Impossible condition occurred in " + server);
        System.out.println("Timeout cannot be less than zero." );
    }
}
```

## SO_REUSEADDR

The `SO_REUSEADDR` option for server sockets is very similar to the same option for client sockets. It determines whether a new socket will be allowed to bind to a previously used port while there might still be data traversing the network addressed to the old socket. As you probably expect, there are two methods to get and set this option:

```java
public boolean getReuseAddress() throws SocketException
public void setReuseAddress(boolean on) throws SocketException
```

The default value is platform dependent. This code fragment determines the default value by creating a new `ServerSocket` and then calling `getReuseAddress()`:

```java
ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket(10240);
System.out.println("Reusable: " + ss.getReuseAddress());
```

On the Linux and Mac OS X boxes where I tested this code, server sockets were reusable by default.

## SO_RCVBUF

The `SO_RCVBUF` option sets the default receive buffer size for client sockets accepted by the server socket. It’s read and written by these two methods:

```java
public int getReceiveBufferSize() throws SocketException
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size) throws SocketException
```

Setting `SO_RCVBUF` on a server socket is like calling `setReceiveBufferSize()` on each individual socket returned by `accept()` (except that you can’t change the receive buffer size after the socket has been accepted). This option suggests a value for the size of the individual IP packets in the stream. Faster connections will want to use larger buffers, although most of the time the default value is fine.

You can set this option before or after the server socket is bound, unless you want to set a receive buffer size larger than 64K. In that case, you must set the option on an unbound `ServerSocket` before binding it. For example:

```java
ServerSocket ss = new ServerSocket();
int receiveBufferSize = ss.getReceiveBufferSize();
if (receiveBufferSize < 131072) {
    ss.setReceiveBufferSize(131072);
}
ss.bind(new InetSocketAddress(8000));
//...
```
