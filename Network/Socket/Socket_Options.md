# Setting Socket Options

Socket options specify **how the native sockets** on which the Java Socket class relies **send and receive data**. Java supports nine options for client-side sockets:

- TCP_NODELAY
- SO_BINDADDR
- SO_TIMEOUT
- SO_LINGER
- SO_SNDBUF
- SO_RCVBUF
- SO_KEEPALIVE
- OOBINLINE
- IP_TOS

The funny-looking names for these options are taken from the named constants in the C header files used in Berkeley Unix where sockets were invented. Thus, they follow classic Unix C naming conventions rather than the more legible Java naming conventions. For instance, `SO_SNDBUF` really means “Socket Option Send Buffer Size.”

## TCP_NODELAY

```java
public void setTcpNoDelay(boolean on) throws SocketException
public boolean getTcpNoDelay() throws SocketException
```

Setting `TCP_NODELAY` to `true` ensures that packets are sent as quickly as possible regardless of their size. Normally, small (one-byte) packets are combined into larger packets before being sent. Before sending another packet, the local host waits to receive acknowledgment of the previous packet from the remote system. This is known as **Nagle’s algorithm**. The problem with Nagle’s algorithm is that if the remote system doesn’t send acknowledgments back to the local system fast enough, applications that depend on the steady transfer of small parcels of information may slow down. This issue is especially problematic for GUI programs such as games or network computer applications where the server needs to track client-side mouse movement in real time. On a really slow network, even simple typing can be too slow because of the constant buffering. Setting `TCP_NODELAY` to `true` defeats this buffering scheme, so that all packets are sent as soon as they’re ready.

`setTcpNoDelay(true)` turns off buffering for the socket. `setTcpNoDelay(false)` turns it back on. `getTcpNoDelay()` returns `true` if buffering is off and `false` if buffering is on. For example, the following fragment turns off buffering (that is, it turns on `TCP_NODELAY`) for the socket s if it isn’t already off:

```java
if (!s.getTcpNoDelay()) s.setTcpNoDelay(true);
```

These two methods are each declared to throw a `SocketException`, which will happen if the underlying socket implementation doesn’t support the `TCP_NODELAY` option.

## SO_LINGER

```java
public void setSoLinger(boolean on, int seconds) throws SocketException
public int getSoLinger() throws SocketException
```

The `SO_LINGER` option specifies what to do with datagrams that have not yet been sent when a socket is closed. **By default**, the `close()` method returns immediately; but the system still tries to send any remaining data. If the linger time is set to `zero`, any unsent packets are thrown away when the socket is closed. If `SO_LINGER` is turned on and the linger time is any positive value, the `close()` method blocks while waiting the specified number of seconds for the data to be sent and the acknowledgments to be received. When that number of seconds has passed, the socket is closed and any remaining data is not sent, acknowledgment or no.

These two methods each throw a `SocketException` if the underlying socket implementation does not support the `SO_LINGER` option. The `setSoLinger()` method can also throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if you try to set the linger time to a **negative value**. However, the `getSoLinger()` method may return `-1` to indicate that this option is disabled, and as much time as is needed is taken to deliver the remaining data; for example, to set the linger timeout for the Sockets to four minutes, if it’s not already set to some other value:

```java
if (s.getTcpSoLinger() == -1) s.setSoLinger(true, 240);
```

The maximum linger time is `65,535` seconds, and may be smaller on some platforms. Times larger than that will be reduced to the maximum linger time. Frankly, `65,535` seconds (more than 18 hours) is much longer than you actually want to wait. Generally, the platform default value is more appropriate.

## SO_TIMEOUT

```java
public void setSoTimeout(int milliseconds) throws SocketException
public int getSoTimeout() throws SocketException
```

Normally when you try to read data from a socket, the `read()` call blocks as long as necessary to get enough bytes. By setting `SO_TIMEOUT`, you ensure that the call will not block for more than a fixed number of **milliseconds**. When the timeout expires, an `InterruptedIOException` is thrown, and you should be prepared to catch it. However, the socket is still connected. Although this `read()` call failed, you can try to read from the socket again. The next call may succeed.

Timeouts are given in **milliseconds**. **Zero** is interpreted as **an infinite timeout**; it is the default value. For example, to set the timeout value of the `Socket` objects to 3 minutes if it isn’t already set, specify `180,000` milliseconds:

```java
if (s.getSoTimeout() == 0) s.setSoTimeout(180000);
```

These two methods each throw a `SocketException` if the underlying socket implementation does not support the `SO_TIMEOUT` option. The `setSoTimeout()` method also throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the specified timeout value is **negative**.

## SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF

**TCP uses buffers to improve network performance**. Larger buffers tend to improve performance for reasonably fast (say, 10Mbps and up) connections whereas slower, dialup connections do better with smaller buffers. Generally, transfers of large, continuous blocks of data, which are common in file transfer protocols such as FTP and HTTP, benefit from large buffers, whereas the smaller transfers of interactive sessions, such as Telnet and many games, do not. Relatively old operating systems designed in the age of small files and slow networks, such as BSD 4.2, use two-kilobyte buffers. Windows XP used 17,520 byte buffers. These days, 128 kilobytes is a common default.

**Maximum achievable bandwidth** equals **buffer size** divided by **latency**. For example, on Windows XP suppose the latency between two hosts is half a second (500 ms). Then the bandwidth is 17520 bytes / 0.5 seconds = 35040 bytes / second = 273.75 kilobits / second. That’s the maximum speed of any socket, regardless of how fast the network is. That’s plenty fast for a dial-up connection, and not bad for ISDN, but not really adequate for a DSL line or FIOS.

**You can increase speed by decreasing latency**. However, latency is a function of the network hardware and other factors outside the control of your application. **On the other hand, you do control the buffer size**. For example, if you increase the buffer size from 17,520 bytes to 128 kilobytes, the maximum bandwidth increases to 2 megabits per second. Double the buffer size again to 256 kilobytes, and the maximum bandwidth doubles to 4 megabits per second. Of course, the network itself has limits on maximum bandwidth. **Set the buffer too high and your program will try to send and receive data faster than the network can handle, leading to congestion, dropped packets, and slower performance**. Thus, when you want maximum bandwidth, you need to match the buffer size to the latency of the connection so it’s a little less than the bandwidth of the network.

The `SO_RCVBUF` option controls the suggested send buffer size used for network input. The `SO_SNDBUF` option controls the suggested send buffer size used for network output:

```java
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
    throws SocketException, IllegalArgumentException
public int getReceiveBufferSize() throws SocketException
public void setSendBufferSize(int size)
    throws SocketException, IllegalArgumentException
public int getSendBufferSize() throws SocketException
```

Although it looks like you should be able to set the send and receive buffers independently, the buffer is usually set to the smaller of these two. For instance, if you set the send buffer to `64K` and the receive buffer to `128K`, you’ll have `64K` as both the send and receive buffer size. Java will report that the receive buffer is `128K`, but the underlying TCP stack will really be using `64K`.

The `setReceiveBufferSize()`/`setSendBufferSize()` methods suggest a number of bytes to use for buffering output on this socket. **However, the underlying implementation is free to ignore or adjust this suggestion**. In particular, Unix and Linux systems often specify a maximum buffer size, typically 64K or 256K, and do not allow any socket to have a larger one. If you attempt to set a larger value, Java will just pin it to the maximum possible buffer size. On Linux, it’s not unheard of for the underlying implementation to double the requested size. For example, if you ask for a 64K buffer, you may get a 128K buffer instead.

These methods throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the argument is less than or equal to **zero**. Although they’re also declared to throw `SocketException`, they probably won’t in practice, because a `SocketException` is thrown for the same reason as `IllegalArgumentException` and the check for the `IllegalArgumentException` is made first.

In general, if you find your application is not able to fully utilize the available bandwidth (e.g., you have a 25 Mbps Internet connection, but your data is transferring at a piddling 1.5 Mbps) try increasing the buffer sizes. **By contrast, if you’re dropping packets and experiencing congestion, try decreasing the buffer size**. However, most of the time, unless you’re really taxing the network in one direction or the other, the defaults are fine. In particular, modern operating systems use TCP window scaling (not controllable from Java) to dynamically adjust buffer sizes to fit the network. As with almost any performance tuning advice, the rule of thumb is not to do it until you’ve measured a problem. And even then you may well get more speed by increasing the maximum allowed buffer size at the operating system level than by adjusting the buffer sizes of individual sockets.

## SO_KEEPALIVE

If `SO_KEEPALIVE` is turned on, the client occasionally sends a data packet over an idle connection (most commonly once every two hours), just to make sure the server hasn’t crashed. If the server fails to respond to this packet, the client keeps trying for a little more than 11 minutes until it receives a response. If it doesn’t receive a response within 12 minutes, the client closes the socket. Without `SO_KEEPALIVE`, an inactive client could live more or less forever without noticing that the server had crashed. These methods turn `SO_KEEPALIVE` on and off and determine its current state:

```java
public void setKeepAlive(boolean on) throws SocketException
public boolean getKeepAlive() throws SocketException
```

The default for `SO_KEEPALIVE` is `false`. This code fragment turns `SO_KEEPALIVE` off, if it’s turned on:

```java
if (s.getKeepAlive()) s.setKeepAlive(false);
```

## OOBINLINE

TCP includes a feature that sends a single byte of “urgent” data out of band. This data is sent immediately. Furthermore, the receiver is notified when the urgent data is received and may elect to process the urgent data before it processes any other data that has already been received. Java supports both sending and receiving such urgent data. The sending method is named, obviously enough, `sendUrgentData()`:

```java
public void sendUrgentData(int data) throws IOException
```

This method sends the **lowest-order byte** of its argument almost immediately. If necessary, any currently cached data is flushed first.

How the receiving end responds to urgent data is a little confused, and varies from one platform and API to the next. Some systems receive the urgent data separately from the regular data. However, the more common, more modern approach is to place the urgent data in the regular received data queue in its proper order, tell the application that urgent data is available, and let it hunt through the queue to find it.

By default, Java ignores urgent data received from a socket. However, if you want to receive urgent data inline with regular data, you need to set the `OOBINLINE` option to `true` using these methods:

```java
public void setOOBInline(boolean on) throws SocketException
public boolean getOOBInline() throws SocketException
```

The default for `OOBINLINE` is `false`. This code fragment turns `OOBINLINE` on, if it’s turned off:

```java
if (!s.getOOBInline()) s.setOOBInline(true);
```

Once `OOBINLINE` is turned on, any urgent data that arrives will be placed on the socket’s input stream to be read in the usual way. Java does not distinguish it from nonurgent data. That makes it less than ideally useful, but if you have a particular byte (e.g., a `Ctrl-C`) that has special meaning to your program and never shows up in the regular data stream, then this would enable you to send it more quickly.

## SO_REUSEADDR

When a socket is closed, it may not immediately release the local port, especially if a connection was open when the socket was closed. It can sometimes wait for a small amount of time to make sure it receives any lingering packets that were addressed to the port that were still crossing the network when the socket was closed. The system won’t do anything with any of the late packets it receives. It just wants to make sure they don’t accidentally get fed into a new process that has bound to the same port.

This isn’t a big problem on a random port, but it can be an issue if the socket has bound to a well-known port because it prevents any other socket from using that port in the meantime. If the `SO_REUSEADDR` is turned on (it’s turned off by default), another socket is allowed to bind to the port even while data may be outstanding for the previous socket.

In Java this option is controlled by these two methods:

```java
public void setReuseAddress(boolean on) throws SocketException
public boolean getReuseAddress() throws SocketException
```

For this to work, `setReuseAddress()` must be called before the new socket binds to the port. This means the socket must be created in an unconnected state using the noargs constructor; then `setReuseAddress(true)` is called, and the socket is connected using the `connect()` method. Both the socket that was previously connected and the new socket reusing the old address must set `SO_REUSEADDR` to `true` for it to take effect.

## IP_TOS Class of Service

**Different types of Internet service have different performance needs**. For instance, video chat needs relatively high bandwidth and low latency for good performance, whereas email can be passed over low-bandwidth connections and even held up for several hours without major harm. VOIP needs less bandwidth than video but minimum jitter. It might be wise to price the different classes of service differentially so that people won’t ask for the highest class of service automatically. After all, if sending an overnight letter cost the same as sending a package via media mail, we’d all just use FedEx overnight, which would quickly become congested and overwhelmed. The Internet is no different.

The class of service is stored in an eight-bit field called `IP_TOS` in the IP header. Java lets you inspect and set the value a socket places in this field using these two methods:

```java
public int getTrafficClass() throws SocketException
public void setTrafficClass(int trafficClass) throws SocketException
```

The traffic class is given as an `int` between `0` and `255`. Because this value is copied to an eight-bit field in the TCP header, only the low order byte of this int is used; and values outside this range cause `IllegalArgumentException`s.
