# What Is Functional Programming?

**Functional programming** is a term that means different things to different people. At the heart of functional programming is thinking about your problem domain in terms of **immutable values** and **functions** that translate between them.

Two of these points (**no shared mutable data** and **the ability to pass methods and functions—code—to other methods**) are the cornerstones of what’s generally described as the paradigm of functional programming.

The word "function" in programming languages is commonly used as a synonym for "method", particularly a **static method**; this is in addition to it being used for mathematical function, **one without side effects**.
