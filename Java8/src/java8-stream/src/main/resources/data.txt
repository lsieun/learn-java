I love three things in this world, the sun ,the moon and you.
The sun for the day, the moon for the night, and you forever!
For the world you are somebody, but for somebody you are the world!
I opend my wallet and found it empty, reached into my pocket and found a few coins,
searched my life and I found you! Then I realized how rich I am.
I drop a tear in the ocean and the day you find it is the day I will stop loving you!
People laugh and people cry, some say hi while some bye,
some give up and some always try, others may forget you but never will I.
